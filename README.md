# SOLID PRINCIPLES

1. Single Responsibility // Swiss knife

    - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
    
2. Open-Closed // Door

    - You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.
    
3. Liskov Substitution // Real and toy Duck

    - Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
    
4. Interface Segregation // Independent logic

    - Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
    
5. Dependency Inversion // Driving

    - Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
